We use the \emph{biblatex} package to handle our references.  We therefore use the
command \texttt{parencite} to get a reference in parenthesis, like this
\parencite{heisenberg2015}.  It is also possible to include the author
as part of the sentence using \texttt{textcite}, like talking about
the work of \textcite{einstein2016}.
