\section{Generative adversarial networks}
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a framework for training generative models proposed by \textcite{goodfellow2014generative}. The framework consists of two neural networks, a generator $G$ and a discriminator $D$.The generator is a mapping between two domains $G: \mathcal{Z} \rightarrow \mathcal{X}$ where $\mathcal{Z}$ is a latent space.
